Feature Ideas:

	credibility
		-some people are just naturally better at picking winners / knowing a good idea
		-should the votes of people with a proven record of seeding/contributing to 
		 good ideas (not sure how we define a "good idea") be prorated higher?
		 
	seeding process
		-at what point is a derivation of the original idea, really not related to the original idea
		-better stated, do we allow seeders to place constraints/limitations on parts of their idea that are fundamental
			i.e. a penut-butter cup cookie can/cannot morph into a salt and vinegar pretzel
			
	sharing
		-allow seeders / anyone else interested to share their ideas on facebook, pintrest, twitter, etc
		
	categories (kind of obvious)
		-in order for anyone interested in actually making these ideas real, we need a process to quickly drill
		 down into a specific genre of idea and see whats the most popular
		

Organization
	good thread:
		http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/107503/is-it-common-to-separate-back-end-and-front-end-into-two-positions-on-web-develo

	Full-Stack, Split-Stack, Other
		Full-Stack = each individual is in charge of specific features (from database -> UI)
		Split-Stack = split into Front-End and Back-End teams ==> REST API
		
		
Technology
	firebase
		-it sounds cool, but i think learning/using it will be as much work as doing our own API
		-is anyone really good at json / non scheme databases (like mongo)
		
	Node.js / Express
		-this class is about the experience, and i think seeing both front and back end is important to 
		 the engineering process
		-Node.js / some other programmed backend gives us unlimitted flexibility to make things work
